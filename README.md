Project Overview

The Weapon Detection project leverages computer vision techniques, specifically OpenCV, and machine learning models to identify and detect weapons in images and video streams. This project aims to enhance security measures by providing a real-time automated system capable of recognizing potential threats.
Features

    Real-Time Detection: Processes live video feeds to detect weapons in real-time.
    Image Detection: Analyzes static images to identify the presence of weapons.
    Bounding Boxes: Highlights detected weapons with bounding boxes and labels.
    
    Technologies Used
  

    Python: Primary programming language for development.
    OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks.
